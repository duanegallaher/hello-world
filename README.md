# hello-world
This is my initial use of GitHub

This is my initial branch entry. My experience in IT goes back to mainframe programming using COBOL, VSAM and ADABAS. Also, a lot of time using Natural/ADABAS and Nat/DB2. I made and exit from IT in 2013 and recently code the bug to code again. Just checking out the new stuff to come out in the last seven years.
